Introduction

    MediaShelf {{{http://www.github.com/mediashelf/uuid-datepath-idmapper}uuid-datepath-idmapper}} 
is an {{{http://akubraproject.org/}Akubra}} IdMapper implementation that uses time-coded 
UUIDs (i.e. UUID version 1) to calculate date-based paths.
    
    For examples of how to use uuid-datepath-idmapper with Fedora, see the 
{{{./usage.html}Usage}} documentation.
